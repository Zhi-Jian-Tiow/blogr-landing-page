## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JQuery

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- This is the first project that I used JQuery. I think JQuery is so much easier to work with than vanilla Javascript to make the web page interactive.
- Better organising for scss code.
- Learned to create two different navbar layout for desktop and mobile each.

### Continued development

- Continue using JQuery in future project.
- Keep on practicing creating navbar and aim to finish them within 1 hour.
